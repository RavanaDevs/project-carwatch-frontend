# Project CarWatch

Project CarWatch, a vehicle information displaying and diagnosing web application, enables real-time monitoring and diagnostics of a vehicle's health. Utilizing ELM327 to retrieve data from the OBD2 port, this project sends information to a web server powered by ESP32. The data is then displayed on a web application, providing users with insights into their vehicle's performance and status.
